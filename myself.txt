I’m not the most experienced in software engineering or advanced coding practices. However, I believe my passion, discipline, and willingness to learn will help me overcome those limitations over time.


###Why do you want to change careers / become a machine learning engineer?
I originally pursued actuarial science with the hope of solving problems in health insurance. But I quickly realized that change is difficult from within due to heavy regulation and a traditionally conservative work environment. I believe I can create a more meaningful impact by building tools powered by LLMs that help consumers make smarter, more informed decisions about insurance—ultimately transforming how the industry is accessed and experienced from the outside.

###What is an actuary?
An actuary is a professional who applies mathematics, statistics, and probability theory to analyze and manage risk. Actuaries work in fields like insurance, finance, and healthcare, where their insights help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions under uncertainty. To become an Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA), I passed a series of rigorous professional exams. These covered topics such as probability, statistics, and predictive analytics, along with advanced material including maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, credibility theory, risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR), and capital modeling.


###What do actuaries do?
Actuaries use mathematics, statistics, and business knowledge to analyze risk and uncertainty, primarily in industries like insurance, finance, and healthcare. Their job is to evaluate the likelihood of future events and help organizations make data-driven decisions that minimize financial risk. In practical terms, actuaries build models to forecast outcomes such as healthcare costs, mortality rates, or customer behavior. They work with large datasets, apply statistical and probabilistic techniques, and communicate their findings to decision-makers to guide pricing, strategy, and risk management. For example, in health insurance, actuaries may project the cost of medical claims for different populations, determine premium rates that ensure financial stability, and assess the impact of regulatory changes. Their work plays a critical role in making sure insurance companies stay solvent while remaining fair to policyholders.

###What tools or programming languages do actuaries use?
Actuaries traditionally use Excel, SAS, and SQL in day-to-day work. In my experience, I've also built models in Python using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, and have leveraged PyTorch for deep learning projects.


###Why did you choose to become an actuary?
I originally pursued actuarial science because I wanted to solve practical problems in health insurance, particularly those involving opaque and often unreasonable pricing structures. I believed that data-driven modeling could offer fairer, more efficient solutions in a highly regulated and complex industry.


###How has your actuarial background helped you in machine learning?
As a health actuary, I specialized in analyzing the financial risks associated with healthcare by applying data modeling, predictive analytics, and statistical inference. This work demanded fluency in handling large datasets, building regression models, and navigating real-world uncertainty such as patient behavior and regulatory impacts. These same skills—especially in data wrangling, probabilistic thinking, and structured decision-making—translate directly into machine learning and LLM engineering. Actuaries are trained to extract insight from complexity and build reliable, quantitative solutions—traits that are critical for designing robust AI systems.
