Their job is to evaluate the likelihood of future events and help organizations make data-driven decisions that minimize financial risk. In practical terms, actuaries build models to forecast outcomes such as healthcare costs, mortality rates, or customer behavior. They work with large datasets, apply statistical and probabilistic techniques, and communicate their findings to decision-makers to guide pricing, strategy, and risk management. For example, in health insurance, actuaries may project the cost of medical claims for different populations, determine premium rates that ensure financial stability, and assess the impact of regulatory changes. Their work plays a critical role in making sure insurance companies stay solvent while remaining fair to policyholders."
